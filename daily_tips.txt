START OF DAY:

* create (hobby project, ideas, something random, etc) [30+ min]
* kiss loved ones
* Make an effort to look/smell your best (just not too much of an effort)

COMMUTING:
* leave extra time for commute - unexpected things might happen on the road.
* think of things you are grateful for, write them down sometimes
* think of ways to help/do something nice to someone later in the day
* ask yourself 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I'm about to do today?' and if the answer is 'no' for a couple of days, think of how to change that.

DAY:
* treat EVERYONE with respect
* follow the platinum rule
* ditch the small talk
* focus on people more than anything else
* don't try to dominate conversations
* recognize the difference between fact and opinion
* be authentic
* have high integrity
* smile, greet people
* love life, have and follow my passion
* help others feel important and valued
* empower others to perform and feel great (provide motivation and means)
* walk the second mile

HAVE A GREAT DAY AND HELP OTHERS HAVE ONE TOO!
AND REMEMBER, IF YOU WANT A MIRRACLE TO HAPPEN - BE ONE FOR SOMEBODY! ;)
