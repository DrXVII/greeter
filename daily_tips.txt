* Hello and wellcome!                                   *
* Today is the first day of all of your remaining life! *
* Below are some tips to make it better ;)              *
*********************************************************

START OF DAY:
* read a good motivational quote
* eat good, healthy food [30 min]
* light excercise [15 min]
* meditate on the day
* create (hobby project, ideas, something random, etc) [30+ min]
* kiss loved ones
* Make an effort to look/smell your best (just not too much of an effort)

COMMUTING:
* leave extra time for commute - unexpected things might happen on the road.
* think of things you are grateful for, write them down sometimes
* think of ways to help/do something nice to someone later in the day
* ask yourself 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I'm about to do today?' and if the answer is 'no' for a couple of days, think of how to change that.

DAY:
* Smile
* Greet people
* Help others feel important and valued
* Empower others to perform great (provide motivation and means)

HAVE A GREAT DAY AND HELP OTHERS HAVE ONE TOO!
AND REMEMBER, IF YOU WANT A MIRRACLE TO HAPPEN - BE ONE FOR SOMEBODY! ;)
